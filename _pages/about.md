I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student at [UConn Health](https://health.uconn.edu/graduate-school/).

In 2021, I earned my B.S. with distinction from [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/) in Indiana, where I trained in molecular cloning and zebrafish techniques as an undergraduate research assistant in [Dr. Qing Deng's lab](https://www.denglab.us/) for two years. After graduation, I moved to Connecticut and joined [Dr. Zhichao Fan's lab](https://zhichaofan1985.wixsite.com/fanlab) at UConn Health as a research assistant, where I continued exploring neutrophils and integrins.

My research interests span bioinformatics analysis of transcriptomic data to disease models in mice, particularly inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). I focus on understanding the role of neutrophils in IBD and exploring potential neural regulation mechanisms of neutrophils in this context.

I am also committed to serving my academic community as the academic chair of the Graduate Student Organization (GSO) and contributing to the research community as an ad hoc reviewer for several journals, including Journal of Leukocyte Biology, Molecular Immunology, and Physiological Genomics.
