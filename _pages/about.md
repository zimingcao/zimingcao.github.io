I am currently a third-year PhD student at [UConn Health](https://health.uconn.edu/graduate-school/).
<br/><br/>

In 2021, I received my B.S. with distinction from [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/) in Indiana, where I got trained on molecular cloning and zebra fish techniques as a undergraduate research assistant in [Dr. Qing Deng's lab](https://www.denglab.us/) for two years. After graduation, I moved to Connecticut and strated as an reseach assitant in [Dr. Zhichao Fan's lab](https://zhichaofan1985.wixsite.com/fanlab) at UConn Health, where I conducted futher research in neutrophils and integrins. 
<br/><br/>

My research interests spaning from bioinformatics analysis on transcroptomic data to mouse disease model, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Specifically, the role of neutrohil in IBD and the potential neural regulation of neutrophils in the context of IBD. 
<br/><br/>

I am also keen to serve my graduate student community as academic chair at Graduate Student Organization (GSO) and research community as ad hoc reviewer for multiple journals including Journal of Leukocyte Biology, Molecular Immunology, and Physiological Genomics, etc.
